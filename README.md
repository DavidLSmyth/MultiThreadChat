# MultiThreadChat
This Program is a simple chat using threads. Open a terminal and type python server.py in server.py's directory. Then open a new terminal and type python GUI.py to launch the client. There's no point in having just one client so you'll need to open another terminal and type python GUI.py as before to start the chat. This program was written as an exercise in socket programming, tkinter and threading but could easily be extended. The program currently will only work locally but with some tweaking could be modified to run on a server e.g. pythonanywhere.
